
blogapp
  simple blogapp, converted to htmx list view with sticky search using cookie
  
  
JSON forms
  
  formsapp
    the simplest implementation of json forms app - meant to be very skiny on features so the concepts are more easy to see.
  
  jsurveyapp
    uses a class to display the form and gather the data on POST
      still skinny on features so the core ideas are more easy to see
      - added homepage, navbars, python-dotenv for local dev.

  formbuilderapp
    an attempt that doesnt work as expected
